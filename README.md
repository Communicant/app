# Communicant

Communicant is the cost-free application that helps anyone who is having trouble communicating, whether it is because of a separation, divorce, or if they are unable to be on speaking terms.

It includes:
* An events page. Where you can organize and display special events such as games, practices or appointments.
* A page that lists expenses so that they can be easily handled.
* A predetermined messaging system so that the parties do not have to directly communicate.

Let Communicant be your mediator without the expense.
